# Lab 03 - Examine registry

In this lab you are going to examine the images you have created with the pipeline.
This step is not necessary, but it will give you some feedback about what you have
created in the pipeline.  

## Task 1: Browse to the registry

On the left side of your project you will find the button `Registry` click this
and the `Container Registry` screen will appear.

The tag of your image will be visable. For example : `username/crapapp-backend`.
You can unfold this and discover all the tags that have been build and deployed.
